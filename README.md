This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on the identification and tracking of tropical cyclones using rainfall and sea level pressure data. The objective is to employ rainfall and sea level pressure data to identify and track cyclones that occurred during the year 2019. We have at our disposal 3-hourly precipitation data and sea level pressure data, both of which are collected within the geographical bounds of latitude 0째 to 30째 and longitude 100째 to 160째, with a specific focus on the Southeast Asia region. By utilizing these datasets, we aim to identify and monitor cyclonic systems that developed and traversed this region throughout the year 2019. This analysis serves as a valuable tool for understanding cyclone behavior and can aid in the prediction and mitigation of cyclone-related hazards in Southeast Asia. The data is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepakb4/trmm-precipitation
